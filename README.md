# LetterBoxd+

LetterBoxd+ is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse Shows that are Currently Airing 

## Feature Walkthrough

The following functionality is present:

- [x] **Using an endpoint from The MovieDB API**
  - Endpoint: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/tv/airing_today`
- [x] **Makes a request to movie endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**
- [x] **Uses Glide to load and display at least one image per entry**
- [x] **Click on an entry to view specific details about that entry using Intents**
- [x] **Rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**

The following is a wishlist for features in case I revisit:

- [ ] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.** 
- [ ] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**
